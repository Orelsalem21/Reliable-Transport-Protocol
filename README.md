# \# Reliable Transport Protocol (Python)

# 

# A Python implementation of a simplified reliable transport protocol, developed as part of an academic computer networks project.

# 

# \## Overview

# This project demonstrates reliable data transfer over an unreliable channel using:

# \- Client–server communication

# \- Sequence numbers and acknowledgments

# \- Sliding window mechanism

# \- Timeout and retransmission logic

# 

# \## Files

# \- `server.py` – Reliable transport server

# \- `client.py` – Reliable transport client

# \- `client\_config.txt` / `server\_config.txt` – Configuration files

# \- `message.txt` – Input message for transmission

# \- `run\_tests.bat` – Script for automated testing

# 

# \## Technologies

# \- Python

# \- Socket programming

# \- Networking protocols

# \- File I/O

# 

# \## How to Run

# 1\. Run the server

# 2\. Run the client

# 3\. Observe reliable message transfer between client and server
